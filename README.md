# splay-fun
A simple side project to implement splay trees in C++. Inspired by [lecture 14 of CS166](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs166/lectures/14/Slides14.pdf).
You can read more about the properties of this structure in either the lecture or ``SplayTree.h``. 

## To use
Code was written and compiled on the Stanford myth machines, so should compile on a standard Linux workflow.
